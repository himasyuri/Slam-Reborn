# About the project
The project was supposed to be replacement [for this popular project](https://github.com/SilentSys/SLAM). [In this project](https://github.com/SilentSys/SLAM) don't work a youtube import and it didn't update for 6 years. So I decided make a remake. My project use MVVM pattern. 

The following approches are not implemented in the project: 
 - list of tracks
 - user settings window requires improvement 
 - and in cs go music don't played.

So CS 2 will be released soon i decided freeze project and come back it later. Now I am doing another project. Those who wish can make pull requests and make this project better. If I will have enough time I will make some improvements.

## Not implemented or does not work
- List of tracks
- User settings window requires improvement
- In cs go music don't played (I think bug is on configs or file's paths)
